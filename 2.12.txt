How to Design your First Programs

Design
	1) Define your goal
	2) Define requirements
		Solution must abide by certain constraints, as well as the capabilities that the program must exhibit in order to meet the users' needs; focus on the "what", not the "how"
	3) Define your tools, targets, and backup plan
	4) Break hard problems down into easy problems
		Top town method > bottom down method (for me)
	5) Figure out the Sequence of Events

Implementation
	1) Outlining your Main Function
	2) Implement Each Function
		1. Define the function prototype (inputs and outputs)
		2. Write the function
		3. Test the function
	3) Final Testing

Words of Advice when Writing Programs
	Keep your programs simple to start
	Add features over time
	Focus on one area at a time
	Test each piece of code as you go
	Don't invest in perfecting early code
