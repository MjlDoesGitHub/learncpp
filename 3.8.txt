Using an Integrated Debugger: Watching Variables

Watching Variables
	Watching a variable is the process of inspecting a variable throughout its execution process

The Watch Window
	A window where you can add variables you would like to continually inspect which will be updated throughout the program
		1. Pull up the watch window, and type in the identifier of the variable for inspection in the leftmost column of the watch window
		2. In the code window, right click on the variable for inspection, and choose Add Watch
	Variables out of scope will be marked as "not available", or may show the last known value but greyed out; once it goes back into scope it will show again
	Visual Studio: Debug menu > Windows > Watch > Watch 1 (can be changed where it is docked by dragging the Watch 1 tab to a different side of the application window)

The Watch Window Can Evaluate Expressions Too
	The watch window will also allow you to evaluate simple expressions
	Identifiers in watched expressions will evaluate to their current values; run to cursor to make sure what value an expression in the program is actually evaluating to

Local Watches
	Many debuggers offer some way to quickly watch the value of all local variables in scope
	Visual Studio: Debug menu > Windows > Locals (must be in a debug session to activate this window)
