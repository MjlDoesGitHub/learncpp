Using an Integrated Debugger: Stepping

The Debugger
	The debugger is twofold: the ability to control, view, and modify (if desired) the program's state
	Most modern IDEs available these days have an integrated debugger

Stepping
	Stepping is an alias for debugging features which allows step by step execution

Step Into
	The step into command executes the next statements and pauses so that the program's current state can be examined
	If the next statement is a function call, it would jump right before the function is being called, where it will pause
	Visual Studio: Debug menu > Step Into; F11 shortcut key
	The yellow arrow that appears to the left of the opening brace of the main() function indicates that the line being pointed to will be executed next

Step Over
	The step over command executes the entire function (as opposed to to line by line) without stopping and return control after execution
	Won't skip over if the current line is already in a function as that is the step out command; must be a function call to skip
	Visual Studio: Debug menu > Step Over; F10 shortcut key

Step Out
	The step out command executes all remaining code in the function and return control after execution
	If main() has multiple functions, it will just execute all of the functions until main() (the curent function) returns
	Visual Studio: Debug menu > Step Out; Shift-F11 shortcut key

A Step Too Far
	Overstepping may occur; stop and restart the debugging sequence if it does so that you can go over your target again

Step Back
	The step back ability allows you to return the program to a prior step for re-examination
	Since this requires a lot of sophistication, it is not standardized yet, and varies by debugger
