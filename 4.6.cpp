// 4.6 â€” FIXED-WIDTH INTEGERS AND SIZE_T

// Why isn't the size of the integer variables fixed?
// Back when computers were slow and performance was of the utmost concern, C opted to intentionally leave the integer sizes open so that the compiler implementors could pick a size for int that performs best on the target computer architecture

// FIXED-WIDTH INTEGERS

// Fixed-width integers are guaranteed to have the same size on any architecture

// Fixed-width integers have two downsides: 1. they are optional and only exist if there are fundamental types matching their widths and following a certain binary representation; 2. a fixed-width integer may be slower than a wider type on some architectures
// Warning: the above fixed-width integers should be avoided, as they may not be defined on all target architectures

// FAST AND LEAST INTEGERS

// Hello World!

// The fast type (std::int_fast#_t) provides the fastest signed integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64); i.e. std::int_least32_t will give the smallest signed integer type that's at least 32 bits

	std::cout << "fast 32: " << sizeof(std::int_fast32_t) * 8 << " bits\n";

// std::int_fast16_t is 32 bits because on the author's machine, 32-bit integers are faster to process than 16-bit integers
// These fast and least integers have their own downsides: 1. lack of familiarity can lead to errors; 2. fast/least integers can vary, so programs may exhibit different behaviors on architectures where they resolve to different sizes

// WARNING: STD::INT8_T AND STD::UINT8_T MAY BEHAVE LIKE CHARS INSTEAD OF INTEGERS

// Due to oversight in C++ specification, most compilers define and treat std::int_8 and std::uint_8 (fast/least fixed-width types) to types signed char and unsigned char

#include <iostream>

	std::uint_fast16_t sometype{ 0 };
	--sometime; //intentionally overflow to invoke wraparound behavior

// The output may print 'A' (treating myint as a char) on most systems, some 65

// Avoid 8-bit fixed-width integer types, as they are often treated like chars

// INTEGRAL BEST PRACTICES

// There is little consensus on integral best practices, however, it's better to be correct than fast. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid fast/least types in favor of the fixed-width types

/*
* Best practice
*	Prefer int when integer size doesn't matter (e.g. # within the range of a 2-byte signed integer); int will cover the vast majority of the cases you're likely to cross
*	Prefer std::int#_t when storing a quantity that needs a guaranteed range
*	Prefer std::uint#_t when doing bit manipulation or when well-defined wrap-around behavior is required
* 
* Avoid the following when possible:
*	Unsigned types for holding quantities
*	The 8-bit fixed-width integer types
*	The fast and least fixed-width types
*	Any compiler-specific fixed-width integers (e.g., Visual Studio defines __int8, __int16, etc...)

// WHAT IS STD::SIZE_T?

#if 0

#include <cstddef> // std::size_t
#include <iostream>

// sizeof (and other functions that return a size of length value) return a value of type std::size_t; this is defined as an unsigned integral type, and it is typically used to represent the size of length of objects

// std::size_t varies in size, but it is guaranteed to be unsigned and at least 16 bits, but on most systems will be equivalent to the address-width of the application

// For 32-bit applications, std::size_t will typically be a 32-bit unsigned integer, and for a 64-bit application, a 64-bit unsigned integer

// size_t is defined to be big enough to hold the size of the largest object creatable on your system (in bytes); for example, if std::size_t is 4 bytes wide, the largest object creatable on your system can't be larger than 4,294,967,295 bytes, because this is the largest number a 4 byte unsigned integer can store

// This is the uppermost limit of an object's size, the real size limit can be lower depending on the compiler you're using

// By definition, any object larger than the largest value size_t can hold is considered (and will cause a compiler error), as the sizeof operator would not be able to return the size without wrapping around
