// 4.6 â€” Fixed-width integers and size_t

// Why isn't the size of the integer variables fixed?
// Back when computers were slow and performance was of the utmost concern, C opted to intentionally leave the integer sizes open so that the compiler implementors could pick a size for int that performs best on the target computer architecture

// Fixed-width integers
// Fixed-width integers are guaranteed to have the same size on any architecture
