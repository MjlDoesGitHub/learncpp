// 4.6 â€” FIXED-WIDTH INTEGERS AND SIZE_T

// Why isn't the size of the integer variables fixed?
// Back when computers were slow and performance was of the utmost concern, C opted to intentionally leave the integer sizes open so that the compiler implementors could pick a size for int that performs best on the target computer architecture

// FIXED-WIDTH INTEGERS

// Fixed-width integers are guaranteed to have the same size on any architecture
/*
 * Name				Type			Range			Notes
 * std::int8_t		1 byte signed	-128 to 127		Treated like a signed char on many systems. See note below.
 * std::uint8_t		1 byte unsigned	0 to 255		Treated like an unsigned char on many systems. See note below.
 * std::int16_t		2 byte signed	-32,768 to 32,767
 * std::uint16_t	2 byte unsigned	0 to 65,535
 * std::int32_t		4 byte signed	-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
 * std::uint32_t	4 byte unsigned	0 to 4,294,967,295
 * std::int64_t		8 byte signed	-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
 * std::uint64_t	8 byte unsigned	0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

// These fixed-width integers can be accessed by including the cstdint header

#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::int16_t i{5};
	std::cout << i;

// Fixed-width integers have two downsides: 1. they are optional and only exist if there are fundamental types matching their widths and following a certain binary representation
