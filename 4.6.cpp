// 4.6 â€” FIXED-WIDTH INTEGERS AND SIZE_T

// Why isn't the size of the integer variables fixed?
// Back when computers were slow and performance was of the utmost concern, C opted to intentionally leave the integer sizes open so that the compiler implementors could pick a size for int that performs best on the target computer architecture

// FIXED-WIDTH INTEGERS

// Fixed-width integers are guaranteed to have the same size on any architecture

 * Name				Type			Range			Notes
 * std::int8_t		1 byte signed	-128 to 127		Treated like a signed char on many systems. See note below.
 * std::uint8_t		1 byte unsigned	0 to 255		Treated like an unsigned char on many systems. See note below.
 * std::int16_t		2 byte signed	-32,768 to 32,767
 * std::uint16_t	2 byte unsigned	0 to 65,535

// Fixed-width integers have two downsides: 1. they are optional and only exist if there are fundamental types matching their widths and following a certain binary representation; 2. a fixed-width integer may be slower than a wider type on some architectures
// Warning: the above fixed-width integers should be avoided, as they may not be defined on all target architectures

// FAST AND LEAST INTEGERS

// The fast type (std::int_fast#_t) provides the fastest signed integer type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64); i.e. std::int_least32_t will give the smallest signed integer type that's at least 32 bits
