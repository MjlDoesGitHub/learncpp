A syntax error occurs when you write a statement that is not valid according to the grammar of the C++ language. This includes errors such as missing semicolons, using undeclared variables, mismatched parentheses or braces, etc… For example, the following program contains quite a few syntax errors:

Once your program is compiling correctly, getting it to actually produce the result(s) you want can be tricky. A semantic error occurs when a statement is syntactically valid, but does not do what the programmer intended.

Modern compilers have been getting better at detecting certain types of common semantic errors (e.g. use of an uninitialized variable). However, in most cases, the compiler will not be able to catch most of these types of problems, because the compiler is designed to enforce grammar, not intent.
