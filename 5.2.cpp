// 5.2 â€” Arithmetic operators

// Unary arithmetic operators

/*
 * There are two unary arithmetic operators, plus (+), and minus (-). They only take one operator.
 *
 * The unary minus operator returns the operator multiplied by -1. For example, x = 5, -x is -5.
 *
 * The unary plus operator returns the value of the operand. In other words, +5 is 5, and +x is x. This operator is
 * pretty much redundant and was added largely to provide symmetry with the unary minus operator.
 *
 * Both of these operators should be placed immediately preceding the operand (e.g. -x, not - x). Do not confuse the
 * unary minus operator with the binary subtraction operator.

// Binary arithmetic operators

/*
 * There are 5 binary arithmetic operators (R->L). The addition, subtraction, and multiplication operators work just
 * like they do in real life, with no caveats. Division and modulus will be elaborated further later on.
